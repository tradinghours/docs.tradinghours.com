### ðŸš€ [Server Mode](https://docs.tradinghours.com/python-library/server-mode/getting-started)
**Run as REST API server**

<div align="center">

</div>


```bash
pip install tradinghours[server]
tradinghours serve
```
```bash
>> curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/markets/US.NYSE
{"fin_id":"US.NYSE","exchange_name":"New York...
```

Perfect for:
- Microservice and multi-language infrastructure
- Low latency and no rate limits
- Fully private and on-premise hosting

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.9 or higher
- **Subscription**: Active TradingHours.com subscription ([get a quote](https://www.tradinghours.com/data))
- **API Token**: Available from [your account page](https://www.tradinghours.com/user/api-tokens)

## Advanced
### Optional Advanced Configuration

Configuration can be changed by creating a `tradinghours.ini` file in the current directory.

These are possible and optional values. The [data] configuration applies to both modes and configures the source for `tradinghours import`, which is what the auto-import feature of the server-mode uses in the background. Please see the [server mode](https://docs.tradinghours.com/python-library/package-mode/configuration) for more details.

```ini
[data]
token = YOUR-TOKEN
source = https://api.tradinghours.com/v4/download

[server-mode]
auto_import_frequency = 360 # in minutes; set to 0 to disable auto-import
allowed_hosts = *
allowed_origins = *
log_folder = tradinghours_server_logs
log_level = DEBUG
log_days_to_keep = 7

[extra]
check_tzdata = True
```

### Data Sources

By default, the library downloads data from the TradingHours.com API. However, you can configure alternative data sources to suit your infrastructure needs.

#### Supported Data Sources

The `source` configuration option supports multiple formats:

##### 1. Default API (HTTPS)
```ini
[data]
token = YOUR-TOKEN
source = https://api.tradinghours.com/v4/download
```
- Uses your API token automatically
- Efficient ETag-based change detection
- Downloads latest data from TradingHours.com
- **This is the default if not specified**

##### 2. Custom HTTPS Endpoint
```ini
[data]
source = https://example.com/data.zip
```
- Uses ETag headers for change detection with a HEAD request
- Falls back to always downloading if headers unavailable
- Useful for custom data distribution servers

##### 3. Local File
```ini
[data]
source = file:///absolute/path/to/data.zip
```
- Uses modification time (mtime) for change detection
- Works cross-platform (Windows/Unix)
- Useful for offline development
- Must be an absolute path

##### 4. S3 Bucket
```ini
[data]
source = s3://bucket/key/data.zip
```
- Requires boto3: `pip install tradinghours[s3]`
- Uses S3 ETag for change detection with a HEAD request
- AWS credentials need to be set up following the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)

#### Change Detection

The library automatically detects data changes using different mechanisms based on the source type:

- **HTTP/HTTPS sources**: Uses ETag from the response of a HEAD request
- **S3 sources**: Uses S3 ETag from the response of a HEAD request
- **Local files**: Uses file modification time (mtime)

::: warning Sources Without ETag Support
If your data source does not support ETag headers, the library will download data and ingest it on every import. If you are using the server-mode, which periodically runs the import in the background, this may cause many redundant imports. To avoid this, set the auto_import_frequency to an appropriate value. See the [server mode configuration](https://docs.tradinghours.com/python-library/server-mode/configuration#automatic-data-updates) for details.

For server mode specific configuration instructions, see:
- [Server Mode Configuration](https://docs.tradinghours.com/python-library/server-mode/configuration)


### Time Zones
This package employs `zoneinfo` for timezone management, utilizing the IANA Time Zone Database, 
which is routinely updated. In certain environments, it's essential to update the `tzdata` package accordingly. 
`tradinghours` automatically checks your `tzdata` version against PyPI via HTTP request, issuing a warning 
if an update is needed.

To update `tzdata` run this command: `pip install tzdata --upgrade`

To disable this verification and prevent the request, add this section to your tradinghours.ini file:
```ini
[extra]
check_tzdata = False
```
