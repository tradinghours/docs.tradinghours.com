## Our Goal

It is our goal to create the most complete, accurate, and easy-to-use trading hours database available.

We have been licensing high-quality trading hours for years.
With the introduction of our [Python Library](https://github.com/tradinghours/tradinghours-python) this dataset has become much easier to use and integrate into your existing applications.

## Why use the Python Library?

As an alternative to using our web-based API directly, there is a Python Library.
This Python Library provides several advantages:

- Fast and easy to integrate trading hours data into your existing applications
- All data is downloaded at once then runs **entirely locally**
- Because the package runs locally, it is extremely fast and avoids [rate limiting](/3.x/api-details#rate-limits)
- Avoid writing complicated code to interpret [trading hours data](/3.x/enterprise/download)

## Getting Started

To start using the library, view the full code and usage documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/tradinghours/tradinghours-python).
