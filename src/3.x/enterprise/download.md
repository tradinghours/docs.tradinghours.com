# Data Downloads

Please use the [`v4/download` endpoint](/4.x/endpoints/download) instead.

The `v3/download` endpoint will remain available, but we recommend switching to `v4`. The primary difference is that `v4` redirects your request to a temporary download URL hosted on S3. This improves reliability, reduces latency, and supports `ETag`-based change detection.
