## Welcome to TradingHours.com

TradingHours.com is the most trusted source for financial calendaring reference data. Our data is carefully collected and verified using only primary sources.

## Why Trading Hours?
Traditionally, it can be difficult to answer simple questions, like "Is the market open now?" or "When does the market close for this holiday?". Yet, it's never been more critical to have the answers to these questions quickly and accurately. Having accurate calendar data can help reduce risks associated with trading, such as failed trades, extra interest paid, and administrative costs.

Our APIs allow you to easily pull market holidays and trading schedule information into your own application or trading algorithm. We've made answering simple questions about markets more effortless than ever before with our comprehensive API.

## How Do We Keep Data Up-to-Date and Accurate?

All data is collected and verified using primary sources.

After data is collected, our skilled team of researchers continuously monitors markets for schedule changes. Once a change is found, we update our database immediately, which reflects in the APIs. This ensures our data is always up-to-date and adheres to the highest standards for accuracy.
