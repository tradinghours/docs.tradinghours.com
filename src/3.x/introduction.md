## Welcome to TradingHours.com

TradingHours.com is the most comprehensive solution for market holidays and trading hours data and is relied upon by thousands of financial professionals every day, including some of the largest financial institutions in the world.

## Why TradingHours.com?

In today's globally connected financial world, it has never been more important to have accurate financial calendar information.

Our data can help you streamline operations, reduce settlement risk, prevent failed trades, avoid extra interest paid due to unexpected settlement delays, back-test trading strategies, and much more.

APIs allow you to easily import market holidays, non-settlement dates, and trading schedule information into your own application while keeping data always up-to-date.

## How data is collected and maintained

All data is carefully researched and verified using only primary sources.

After data is collected, our research team continuously monitors markets for schedule changes. Once a change is found, the database is updated and immediately reflected in the APIs. This ensures your data is always up-to-date and adheres to the highest standards for accuracy.

## Data Licensing

Data licenses are available for enterprise firm, retail investors, and applications developers.

We suggest the **Market Status API** for retail investors, website developers, or application developers.
This API tells you if a market is open or closed right now and when it opens or closes next.
This is a very powerful tool that lets you add countdowns or market status indicators to your own website or app.

For enterprise-level and institutional investors, we make available our entire database of past and future market holidays and trading hours.

In both the Market Status API and Enterprise API subscriptions, we offer three tiers of access. This ensures you only pay for the data you need. The three options are:
- Core Markets: Includes the 25 largest equity markets around the world.
- Emerging Markets: Includes Core Markets plus all global equity markets.
- All Markets: Includes all from Core and Emerging, plus derivative markets.

Custom packages are also available.

## Data Delivery

Data can be accessed through our API or [downloaded in bulk](/3.x/enterprise/download) as a zip file. Delivery formats through the API are JSON and CSV. Bulk flat file downloads are in CSV and Excel format.

All data is fully machine-readable and ready for integration into your own application. 

::: tip Python Library
The Python library and its ***Server Mode*** allow you to access the flat files in a highly performant and user-friendly way on your own machine. [Learn more about the Python library â†’](https://docs.tradinghours.com/python-library)

## Versioning

Version 3 is the latest API version. Previous versions are still available, but only for existing customers.
If a breaking change is made to the API, a new version will be released.

A _breaking change_ is if a field in the API response is changed or removed.

We may add fields at anytime. We do not consider adding new fields to be a breaking change.
Similarly, we may add fields to the CSV and Excel files available through the [bulk download endpoint](/3.x/enterprise/download).

Changed will be documented in the [change log](/change-log).
